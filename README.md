# DL_project_Group33

Deadline: 30th April 

Description:

In this project, you will develop a deep-learning model to classify rare species based on their
images. The dataset used in this project consists of images of rare species sourced from the
Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and curated as part of the BioCLIP: A Vision Foundation Model
for the Tree of Life [1] study. Each image is associated with metadata, including its kingdom,
phylum, and family.
Your objective is to build a model that predicts the family of a given species based on its image.
The dataset includes a structured CSV file containing the file path of each image alongside its
corresponding labels. As part of the project, you will need to create your own data splits into
training, validation, and test sets. The training and validation sets will be used to develop and
fine-tune your model, while the test set should be kept separate to evaluate its performance on
unseen data.
